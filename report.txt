Case 1: using pre-recorded scores for the top 3 moves (2 computer moves if computer starts, 1 computer move if human starts).
We can see that counter, which counts how many times the min-max function was called recursively, and counter2 how many times the pre-recorded scores where examined (we have one counter for first, second, third moves (4th and 5th are not used):

In this case, for the first two moves, only one call, while using the pre-recorded scores less than 10 times.
For the 3rd move, almost 90 times recursion search, than only 8, than the last one - only once, 

So with pre-recorded scores, we call the min-max only 99 times.

counter  1 counter2  [ 9, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
counter  1 counter2  [ 0, 0, 7, 0, 0 ]
counter  88 counter2  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
counter  8 counter2  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
counter  1 counter2  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

Case 2: as it was before - no use of pre-recorded scores:
so for the first move, it is almost 300k times. Than in the third move it drops to almost 4K, than it is as in case 1.
Usually, the first move is too much for the tiny fitbit processor... :(.

C:\Users\User\Google Drive\workspace\js\fitbit>node index.js
counter  294778 counter2  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
counter  3864 counter2  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
counter  90 counter2  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
counter  6 counter2  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

In total, the pre-recorded scores for the top 3 moves is only 585. A bit more than 9*8*7. Can you tell why?
